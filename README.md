- 👋 Hi, I’m @radulovicc
- 👀 I’m interested in learning ways of using programming languages other than just in console
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c#, and I've been learning c++ and c for two years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects that include using these programming languages and i want to gain some experience because I don't have much of it.
